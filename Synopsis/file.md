 \section{\bfseries Feasibility Study}  
  
\end{center}
\begin{justify}
 A feasibility study is a preliminary study which investigates the information needs of perspective users and determines the resource requirements, determining the cost effectiveness of various alternatives in the designs of the information system, benefits and feasibility of proposed project. The goal of the feasibility study is to evaluate alternative systems to propose the most feasible and desirable systems for development. The feasibility of our proposed system can be evaluated as: -
   \newline
   \newline
•	TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY Technical feasibility can be demonstrated if reliable hardware and software capable of meeting needs of proposed system can be developed or acquired by the business in required time. Our project is technically feasible because the required hardware and software needed for our project are available.
Economic feasibility: This assessment typically involves a cost analysis of the project.
This project developed is full software based, so there is no much cost required.
\newline
\newline
•	ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY: This assessment typically involves a cost analysis of the project. This project developed is full software based, so there is no much cost required.
\newline
\newline
•	OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY Operational feasibility is a measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development. As the proposed system was very light weighted and small sized, this system is expected to operate on almost every device. The requirements of the website are also very small therefore it is easy to operate in every environment. As all components needed to develop the proposed system are also available, the system will definitely work. Hence the project is operationally feasible.
